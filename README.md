Software for implementing A Two-Stage Method for Decorrelating the Errors in  Log-Linear Models for Spectral Density Comparisons in Neural Spike Sequences. MATLAB source code files concern
the estimation of the SDFs of gamma, alpha, and a combination of gamma and alpha motoneurons (step 1 of the proposed methodology). R source code files concern steps 2-5 and 2-6 (changepoint case) of the proposed methodology. Each of the source files is named after the specific case cited on paper. The script titled fig1 produces Fig.1 of the paper, based on the functions of the three signals (alfa_gamma.m, alpha.m, gamma.m).
