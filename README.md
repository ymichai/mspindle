Software for implementing A Two-Stage Method for Decorrelating the Errors in  Log-Linear Models for Spectral Density Comparisons in Neural Spike Sequences. MATLAB source code files for
the estimation of the SDFs of gamma, alpha, and a combination of gamma and alpha motoneurons (step 1 of the proposed methodology). R source code files steps 2-5 and 2-6 (changepoint case)
of the proposed methodology. Each of the source files is named after the specific case cited on paper.
